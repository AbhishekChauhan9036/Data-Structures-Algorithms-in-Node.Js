Solve these Problems on VsCode:-

Q1. Find the largest three distinct elements in an array

Input: arr[] = {10, 4, 3, 50, 23, 90}
Output: 90, 50, 23

Q2.Find the Missing Number
Given an array arr[] of size N-1 with integers in the range of [1, N], the task is to find the missing number from the first N integers.
Note: There are no duplicates in the list.
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8}, N = 8
Output: 5

Q3.Take an integers of array by yourself and Perform following operations Search, insert and delete in a sorted array

Q4.Binary Search for Rational Numbers without using floating point arithmetic
A rational is represented as p/qb, for example 2/3. Given a sorted array of rational numbers, how to search an element using Binary Search. Use of floating-point arithmetic is not allowed.
Input:  arr[] = {1/5, 2/3, 3/2, 13/2}
x = 3/2
Output: Found at index 2











Sorting:-
Q1.How many types of Sorting? Name them
Q2.Explain these terms with its time Complexity in worst case , Average Case & Best case:- 
1. Insertion sort   2. Selection sort  3.Bubble sort   4. Quick sort   5. Merge sort
Q3.Differentiate  between:-
Insertion sort  Vs  Selection sort  Vs  Bubble sort  Vs  Quicksort Vs Merge sort
