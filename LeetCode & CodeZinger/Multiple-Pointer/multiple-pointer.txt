Q1 Given two sorted arrays and a number x, find the pair whose sum is closest to x and the pair has an element from each array. 
a).
Input:  ar1[] = {1, 4, 5, 7};
        ar2[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
        x = 32      
Output:  1 and 30

b).
Input: arr[] = {10, 22, 28, 29, 30, 40}, x = 54

Output: 22 and 30

Q2.Given an array of distinct elements. The task is to find triplets in the array whose sum is zero.
Input:  arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}
Output:  (0 -1 1), (2 -3 1)
 Explanation: The triplets with zero sum are 0 + -1 + 1 = 0 and 2 + -3 + 1 = 0
